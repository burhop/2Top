=== Debugging Area Region Serialization Test Case ===
Test point: (0, 0)
Expected: point should be inside outer boundary but not in any hole
Original region contains point: True

=== Serialization ===
Serialized data keys: ['type', 'outer_boundary', 'holes']
Outer boundary type: CompositeCurve
Number of holes: 2

=== Deserialization ===
Reconstructed region contains point: False

=== Component Analysis ===
Outer boundary:
  Original outer contains point: True
  Reconstructed outer contains point: False
Holes:
  Hole 1 original contains point: False
  Hole 1 reconstructed contains point: False
  Hole 2 original contains point: False
  Hole 2 reconstructed contains point: False

=== Mask Function Analysis ===
Original segment mask at (0, 0): True
Reconstructed segment mask at (0, 0): True
Original curve evaluation: 3
Reconstructed curve evaluation: 3

=== Debugging Boundary Point Test Case ===
Test point: (1.0, 0.0)
Expected: point should be on circle boundary between first and fourth quadrants
Composite curve is_closed(): True
Segment 1 (First quadrant) contains point: True
  Mask condition: True
  Circle evaluation: 0.0
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): True
Segment 2 (Second quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: False
  Circle evaluation: 0.0
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): True
Segment 3 (Third quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: False
  Circle evaluation: 0.0
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): True
Segment 4 (Fourth quadrant) contains point: True
  Mask condition: True
  Circle evaluation: 0.0
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): True
Composite curve contains point: True
Composite curve contains point (tol=1e-10): True

=== Mask Condition Details ===
First quadrant mask (x >= 0 and y >= 0):
  x >= 0: True
  y >= 0: True
  Combined: True
Fourth quadrant mask (x >= 0 and y <= 0):
  x >= 0: True
  y <= 0: True
  Combined: True

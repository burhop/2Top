=== Debugging Overlapping Segments Test Case ===
Test point: (0.707, 0.707)
Expected: point should be on circle boundary in first quadrant
Composite curve is_closed(): False
Segment 1 (right half) contains point: True
Segment 2 (upper half) contains point: True
Composite curve contains point: False

=== Individual Segment Debug ===
Circle evaluation at test point: -0.0003020000000001355
Point is on circle boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): True
Segment 1 mask (x >= 0): True
Segment 2 mask (y >= 0): True
Segment 1 contains (tol=1e-10): False
Segment 1 contains (tol=1e-3): True
Segment 2 contains (tol=1e-10): False
Segment 2 contains (tol=1e-3): True

=== Debugging Inside Point Test Case ===
Test point: (0.5, 0.5)
Expected: point should be inside circle but not on boundary, so should return False
Composite curve is_closed(): True
Segment 1 (First quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: True
  Circle evaluation: -0.5
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): False
Segment 2 (Second quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: False
  Circle evaluation: -0.5
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): False
Segment 3 (Third quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: False
  Circle evaluation: -0.5
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): False
Segment 4 (Fourth quadrant) contains point: False
  Mask condition: False
  Circle evaluation: -0.5
  On boundary (|f| <= 1e-3): False
Ray-casting algorithm result (inside region): True
Composite curve contains point: False

=== Analysis ===
Point (0.5, 0.5) is inside the unit circle: True
Point is in first quadrant: True
Distance from origin: 0.707
Circle evaluation: -0.5

For a closed composite curve representing a circle boundary:
- Points INSIDE the circle should return False (not contained)
- Points ON the boundary should return True (contained)
- Points OUTSIDE the circle should return False (not contained)

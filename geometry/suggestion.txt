‚úÖ Your Plan is Solid
Let me reinforce that the idea to explicitly store known bounding boxes for well-defined shapes like squares or rectangles is a best-practice approach used in many CAD kernels and FEA codes. You‚Äôre taking control instead of relying on error-prone sampling.

Your 4-step plan covers:

Defining bounds at creation

Prioritizing explicit over sampled bounding boxes

Propagating through shape constructors

Making it serialization-safe

This creates a strong foundation for downstream algorithms like ray-casting.

üß† My Suggestions (Complementary Ideas)
Here are some enhancements or alternatives you could optionally explore:

üîÅ 1. Hybrid Bounding Box: Combine Explicit + Sampled
Sometimes you have:

A symbolic bound (square edge)

But the mask is more complex (e.g. trimmed circle)

So make bounding_box() do this:

python
Copy
Edit
def bounding_box(self):
    if self._explicit_bounds is not None:
        return self._explicit_bounds
    return self._compute_sampled_bounds()
Or even:

python
Copy
Edit
def bounding_box(self):
    if self._explicit_bounds:
        return self._explicit_bounds
    elif self._is_axis_aligned_box_like():
        return self._infer_axis_bounds()
    else:
        return self._sampled_bounds()
This gives you fast, precise handling for known cases, but still degrades gracefully for general curves.

=== Debugging Ray-casting Intersections ===
Test point: (0, 0)
Square bounds: (-3, -3) to (3, 3)
Expected: ray from (0,0) to right should intersect right edge at (3,0)

=== Ray-casting Intersection Analysis ===

Segment 0:
  Original curve: y + 3
  Reconstructed curve: y + 3
  Original intersections: 0
  Reconstructed intersections: 0

Segment 1:
  Original curve: x - 3
  Reconstructed curve: x - 3
  Original intersections: 1
  Reconstructed intersections: 1

Segment 2:
  Original curve: y - 3
  Reconstructed curve: y - 3
  Original intersections: 0
  Reconstructed intersections: 0

Segment 3:
  Original curve: x + 3
  Reconstructed curve: x + 3
  Original intersections: 0
  Reconstructed intersections: 0

=== Final Results ===
Original ray-casting: True
Reconstructed ray-casting: True
